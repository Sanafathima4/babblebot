### Project Description it is a chatbot which is useless because it react like a baby 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The chatbot is seen as useless because it responds like a baby, meaning its answers are simplistic and lack depth. It may not understand context or nuances, failing to provide meaningful insights. This limits its effectiveness in helping users with their queries or concerns, making it seem immature.
